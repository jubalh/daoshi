# Overview #

daoshi is a vocabulary program tailored to learning chinese and other languages with non latin scripts.

The project got created as a [Hackweek project](https://hackweek.suse.com/13/projects/1182) and it's goal was for me to improve and learn my skills of C++ and the Qt Framework.

# Status #
The project is already in a usable state but I will continue to improve it and add more features in my free time.
At this point you need to edit the XML files by hand and create the lessons yourself like this.
You then can learn them but there is not yet a mode for actual review.
The foreign character gets displayed, upon clicking you can see these informations: the transliteration, the translation, a note and usage examples.
You can also listen to the pronunciation if the lesson creator added an audio file.

# Preview #
