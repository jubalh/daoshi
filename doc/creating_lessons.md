# Creating Lessons #

All lessons reside in `~/.local/share/daoshi/lessons`.
The name of the folder will determine the lessons name.
It is expected to contain a `content.xml` compatible with the XML schema which can be found in the resources subfolder of the source code, the audio and image files.

The image files need to be GIF files which can be obtained from the [Stroke Order Project](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Stroke_Order_Project). It will display a character and show the stroke order.
Whenever there is a character missing it is encouraged not just to create the GIF for oneself but upload it and thus contribute to the Stroke Order Project.

A good resource which will find more use in later versions is the [CC-CEDICT](http://cc-cedict.org/wiki/). It can help you with creating new lessons. I plan to add a resource to find audio pronunciation examples licensed under the creative commons and suspect that there is one from which the [MDBG](http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php) draws its audio files.

It is encouraged to use OGG vorbis.

For an example lesson please take a look at [this](https://github.com/jubalh/daoshi-test-lesson).
