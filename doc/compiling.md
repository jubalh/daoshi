You can either open the daoshi.pro file with QtCreator or run:

```
qmake-qt5
make
./daoshi
```

`qmake` usually points to a Qt4 version of qmake, so on my system I want to use `qmake-qt5` it is totally possible that on your system this varies.
`make` builds the project and `./daoshi` starts the program.
